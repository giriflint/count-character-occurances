# Count Character Occurances
Hello!

We'd like you to write a small executable in C that:

    * Reads in a filepath as a command line argument
    * Counts the number of instances of each character
    * Prints the number of instances to stdout

In addition:

    * Some sort of build script/makefile/etc to build your C executable
    * Please include a `-h` option, for sanity

You can generate a test file by doing: `./generate_test_file.py -o output.txt`

If it helps, you can also output all the characters used to generate the random
files by doing: `./generate_test_file.py --print-chars`
