# Count Character Occurances
Hello!

We'd like you to write a small executable in C that:

    * Reads in a filepath as a command line argument
    * Counts the number of instances of each character
    * Prints the number of instances to stdout

In addition:

    * Some sort of build script/makefile/etc to build your C executable
    * Please include a `-h` option, for sanity


You can generate a test file by doing: `generate_test_file.py -f output.txt`.
